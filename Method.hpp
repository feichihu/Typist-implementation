/*  ASSUMPTION: This typist follows the priciples of Assumption 1-7 in the TYPIST paper, with the following modifications:
  In Assumption 2b, the typist uses both hands, with one finger for each hand in typing
  In Assumption 3, the perceptual processor stays 3 chunks ahead
  In Assumption 4, the typist use a word as a chunk and there is no restricted view issue
  In Assumption 5, 
  In Assumption 6, 
    Perceptual duration is 340ms
    Cognitive duration is 50ms
  In Assumption 7, The only difference bewtween different typists(methods) is their motor operator duration:
    Novice is 230ms
    Intermediate is 170ms
    Expert is 30ms
*/

/* Here is one important observation:
    !!!The Perceptual operator will not apppear in the critical path except at the beginning.
    This is because the shortest 3 words chunk in the sample phrase is "the lazy dog",
    which is has a duration larger than 600ms, even if we only consider the cognitive durations.
    Therefore, critical path can only pass nodes in cognitive operators and motor operators after the first word.
    Thus, for the purpose of reducing complexity, we only consider cognitive and motor operators in this program,
    while adding 340ms to the final result to represent the perceptual of the first word.

    ASSUMPTION: We reperesent schedule chart by doubly linked list of operators. The dependency is represented by
