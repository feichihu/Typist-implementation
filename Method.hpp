/*  ASSUMPTION: This typist follows the priciples of Assumption 1-7 in the TYPIST paper, with the following modifications:
  In Assumption 2b, the typist uses both hands, with one finger for each hand in typing
  In Assumption 3, the perceptual processor stays 3 chunks ahead
  In Assumption 4, the typist use a word as a chunk and there is no restricted view issue
  In Assumption 5, 
  In Assumption 6, 
    Perceptual duration is 340ms
    Cognitive duration for fetch a word is 50 ms
    Cognitive duration for single key is keyboard search time
    Motor duration is fitts' law movement time
  !!!The only difference bewtween different typists(methods) is their keyboard search duration
*/

/* Here is one important assumption:
    This program only simulate input of letters and space. Any other character is not supported due to lack of experimental data.
    Also, this program does not distinguish UPPER or lower cases(no shift key), since usually mobile keyboard will automatically switch cases.

    ASSUMPTION: We reperesent schedule chart by linked list of operators. The dependency is represented by
